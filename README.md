-- Well, this one was quite something. It was fun and challenging to get all things to look good and not overlap or take up too much space.

-- I struggled at the beginning with making the image and the rest of the content inline. However, the real final boss was changing the image with screen size because I applied the media query last without overhauling my HTML and CSS to use a background-image. After a bit of research, I discovered that I can simply change the content of the img.

-- I don't really like the fact that on smaller screen sizes (not below 375px) the content will overlap.
